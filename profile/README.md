Welcome to the Official GitHub repository for Descope. We provide an easy-to-use and secure service to seamlessly handle user management and authentication across various applications. Our integration approaches range from utilizing Descope Flows to create your own authentication with a no-code drag-and-drop workflow, to integrating directly with your application server.
