Welcome to the Official GitHub repository for Descope. We provide an easy-to-use and secure service to seamlessly handle user management and authentication across various applications.

Our integration approaches range from utilizing Descope Flows to create authentication with a no-code drag-and-drop workflow, to integrating directly with your application server.

You can either use Descope with our wide variety of SDKs or use Descope as an [OpenID Connect](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/oidc) provider with another IdP.

Beyond traditional auth, Descope also powers AI & MCP use cases, making it simple to add authentication and authorization for AI agents and services. Learn more in our [AI & MCP section](#-descope-ai--mcp-use-cases) or visit [descope.ai](https://descope.ai).
